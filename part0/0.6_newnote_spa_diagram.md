    Note : The command document.getElementById('notes_form') instructs the code to fetch a reference to the HTML form element on the page that has the ID "notes_form" and to register an event handler to handle the form's submit event. The event handler creates a new note, adds it to the notes list with the command notes.push(note), rerenders the note list on the page and sends the new note to the server.
